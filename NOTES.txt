bingham_kf --> bingham filter 

	Like a kalman filter but uses binghams instead of gaussians

bingham_registration --> registration_est

	estimates transformation between two point clouds

	Kalman-filter-like "state" JUST for rotation

	ZK = width of gaussian on a sphere
	MK = peak of that distribution

	Zk is a diagonal matrix with its first element as zero. The lambdas are set to tiny values because we assume we have no prior
	They will increase as time goes on

	MK = four column vector. the first is the most likely quaternion

	First for loop is num iterations of this filter (Maybe we should make it loop such that it reuses windows if necessary)

	Maybe do randomization on moving points IN filter
